# Web_Portifolio_Artistico


Objective: Create new website. 
Description: I chose to create a website for my artist aunt. Where the user could read her biography and exhibitions, leave messages, follow her on social media, learn about her techniques, filter the artistic works by year and applied technique.   
The artistic works were inserted in a json file and I used the events in JS under the object.
Tech Used: JavaScript, Json, CSS and HTML.
